The
<a href="http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~langmea">Langmead</a>
and
<a href="http://bioinformatics.igm.jhmi.edu/salzberg">Salzberg</a>
labs currently have open positions for postdoctoral researchers.  See

</ul>

<h2>Version 2.0.5 - Coming soon</h2>
<ul>
 <li>Fixed an issue that would cause excessive memory allocation when aligning
     to very repetitive genomes.</li>
 <li>Fixed an issue that would cause a pseudo-randomness-related assert to be
     thrown in debug mode under rare circumstances.</li>
 <li>When <tt>bowtie2-build</tt> fails, it will now delete index files created so far so
     that invalid index files don't linger.</li>
 <li>Tokenizer no longer has limit of 10,000 tokens, which was a problem for
     users trying to index a very large number of FASTA files.</li>
 <li>Updated manual's discussion of the
 <tt><a href="manual.shtml#bowtie2-options-I">-I</a></tt> and
 <tt><a href="manual.shtml#bowtie2-options-X">-X</a></tt> options to mention that
     setting them farther apart makes Bowtie 2 slower.</li>
 <li>Renamed <tt>COPYING</tt> to <tt>LICENSE</tt> and created a <tt>README</tt> to be GitHub-friendly.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Version 2.0.4 - December 17, 2012</h2>
<ul>
 <li>Fixed issue whereby
<tt><a href="manual.shtml#bowtie2-options-un">--un</a></tt>,
<tt><a href="manual.shtml#bowtie2-options-al">--al</a></tt>,
<tt><a href="manual.shtml#bowtie2-options-un-conc">--un-conc</a></tt>, and
<tt><a href="manual.shtml#bowtie2-options-al-conc">--al-conc</a></tt>
 options would
     incorrectly suppress SAM output.</li>
 <li>Fixed minor command-line parsing issue in wrapper script.</li>
 <li>Fixed issue on Windows where wrapper script would fail to find
     <tt>bowtie2-align.exe</tt> binary.</li>
 <li>Updated some of the index-building scripts and documentation.</li>
 <li>Updated author's contact info in usage message</li>
</ul>

<h2>Version 2.0.3 - December 14, 2012</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed thread safely issues that could cause crashes with a large number of
     threads.  Thanks to John Oâ€™Neill for identifying these issues.</li>
<li>Fixed some problems with pseudo-random number generation that could cause
     unequal distribution of alignments across equally good candidate loci.</li>
<li>The
<tt><a href="manual.shtml#bowtie2-options-un">--un</a></tt>,
<tt><a href="manual.shtml#bowtie2-options-al">--al</a></tt>,
<tt><a href="manual.shtml#bowtie2-options-un-conc">--un-conc</a></tt>, and
<tt><a href="manual.shtml#bowtie2-options-al-conc">--al-conc</a></tt>
     options (and their compressed
     analogs) are all much faster now, making it less likely that they become
     the bottleneck when Bowtie 2 is run with large
<tt><a href="manual.shtml#bowtie2-options-p">-p</a></tt>.</li>
<li>Fixed issue with innaccurate mapping qualities, <tt>XS:i</tt>, and <tt>YS:i</tt> flags when
<tt><a href="manual.shtml#bowtie2-options-no-mixed">--no-mixed</a></tt> and
<tt><a href="manual.shtml#bowtie2-options-no-discordant">--no-discordant</a></tt>
are specified at the same time.</li>
<li>Fixed some compiler warnings and errors when using <tt>clang++</tt> to compile.</li>
<li>Fixed race condition in <tt>bowtie2</tt> script when named pipes are used.</li>
<li>Added more discussion of whitespace in read names to manual.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Sourceforge spam</h2>
<ul>
<li>Spam on the sourceforge tracker (i.e. where feature requests and bug
    reports go) was getting out of control, so I disabled posting by anonymous
	users.  This means you'll have to use some set of credentials when posting
	on the tracker.  Sourceforge allows you to use various, e.g., your Google
	credentials.   Sorry for the invonvenience, but I think this will make the
	experience better overall.
</ul>

<h2>Version 2.0.2 - October 31, 2012</h2>
<ul>
 <li>Fixes a couple small issues pointed out to me immediately after 2.0.1
     release</li>
 <li>Mac binaries now built on 10.6 in order to be forward-compatible with more
     Mac OS versions</li>
 <li>Small changes to source to make it compile with gcc versions up to 4.7
     without warnings</li>
</ul>


<h2>Version 2.0.1 - October 31, 2012</h2>
<ul>
 <li>First non-beta release.</li>
 <li>Fixed an issue that would cause Bowtie 2 to use excessive amounts of
     memory for closely-matching and highly repetitive reads under some
     circumstances.</li>
 <li>Fixed a bug in
     <tt><a href="manual.shtml#bowtie2-options-mm">--mm</a></tt>
      mode that would fail to report when an index file
     could not be memory-mapped.</li>
 <li>Added
     <tt><a href="manual.shtml#bowtie2-options-non-deterministic">--non-deterministic</a></tt>
	 option, which better matches how some users
     expect the pseudo-random generator inside Bowtie 2 to work.  Normally, if
     you give the same read (same name, sequence and qualities) and
	 <tt><a href="manual.shtml#bowtie2-options-seed">--seed</a></tt>, you
     get the same answer.  
     <tt><a href="manual.shtml#bowtie2-options-non-deterministic">--non-deterministic</a></tt>
	 breaks that guarantee.  This can
     be more appropriate for datasets where the input contains many identical
     reads (same name, same sequence, same qualities).</li>
 <li>Fixed a bug in <tt>bowtie2-build</tt> would yield corrupt index files when memory
     settings were adjusted in the middle of indexing.</li>
 <li>Clarified in manual that <tt>--un-*</tt> options print reads exactly as
     they appeared in the input, and that they are not necessarily written in
     the same order as they appeared in the input.</li>
 <li>Fixed issue whereby wrapper would incorrectly interpret arguments with
     <tt>--al</tt> as a prefix (e.g.
	 <tt><a href="manual.shtml#bowtie2-options-a">--all</a></tt>) as
	 <tt><a href="manual.shtml#bowtie2-options-al">--al</a></tt>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Version 2.0.0-beta7 - July 13, 2012</h2>
<ul>
 <li>Fixed an issue in how Bowtie 2 aligns longer reads in
      <tt><a href="manual.shtml#bowtie2-options-local">--local</a></tt>.
	 mode.  Some
     alignments were incorrectly curtailed on the left-hand side.</li>
 <li>Fixed issue whereby
      <tt><a href="manual.shtml#bowtie2-options-un">--un</a></tt> or
      <tt><a href="manual.shtml#bowtie2-options-un-conc">--un-conc</a></tt>
	 would fail to output unaligned reads when
     <tt><a href="manual.shtml#bowtie2-options-no-unal">--no-unal</a></tt>
	  was also specified.</li>
 <li>Fixed issue whereby 
      <tt><a href="manual.shtml#bowtie2-options-un">--un</a></tt> or
      <tt><a href="manual.shtml#bowtie2-options-un-conc">--un-conc</a></tt> 
      were significantly slowing down Bowtie 2 when
     <tt><a href="manual.shtml#bowtie2-options-p">-p</a></tt>
	 was set greater than 1.</li>
 <li>Fixed issue that would could cause hangs in
     <tt><a href="manual.shtml#bowtie2-options-a">-a</a></tt>
	 mode or when
	 <tt><a href="manual.shtml#bowtie2-options-k">-k</a></tt>
	 was set high.</li>
 <li>Fixed issue whereby the SAM FLAGS field could be set incorrectly for
     secondary paired-end alignments with
	 <tt><a href="manual.shtml#bowtie2-options-a">-a</a></tt>
	 or
	 <tt><a href="manual.shtml#bowtie2-options-k">-k</a></tt>
	 > 1.</li>
 <li>When input reads are unpaired, Bowtie 2 no longer removes the trailing
     <tt>/1</tt> or <tt>/2</tt> from the read name.</li>
 <li><tt>-M</tt> option is now deprecated.  It will be removed in subsequent versions.
     What used to be called <tt>-M</tt> mode is still the default mode, and
	 <tt><a href="manual.shtml#bowtie2-options-k">-k</a></tt>
	 and
	 <tt><a href="manual.shtml#bowtie2-options-a">-a</a></tt>
     are still there alternatives to the default mode, but adjusting the <tt>-M</tt>
     setting is deprecated.  Use the
	 <tt><a href="manual.shtml#bowtie2-options-D">-D</a></tt>
	 and
	 <tt><a href="manual.shtml#bowtie2-options-R">-R</a></tt>
	 options to adjust the effort
     expended to find valid alignments.</li>
 <li>Gaps are now left-aligned in a manner similar to BWA and other tools.</li>
 <li>Fixed issue whereby wrapper script would not pass on exitlevel correctly,
     sometimes spuriously hiding non-0 exitlevel.</li>
 <li>Added documentation for <tt>YT:Z</tt> to manual.</li>
 <li>Fixed documentation describing how Bowtie 2 searches for an index given an
     index basename.</li>
 <li>Fixed inconsistent documentation for the default value of the
     <tt><a href="manual.shtml#bowtie2-options-i">-i</a></tt>
	 parameter </li>
</ul>
