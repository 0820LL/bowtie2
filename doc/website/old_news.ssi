<h2>Version 2.0.0-beta4 - December 6, 2011</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Accuracy improvements.</li>
  <li>Speed improvements in some situations.</li>
  <li>Fixed a handful of crashing bugs.</li>
  <li>Fixed some documentation bugs.</li>
  <li>Fixed bug whereby <tt><a href="manual.shtml#bowtie2-options-version">--version</tt></a> worked incorrectly.</li>
  <li>Fixed formatting bug with MD:Z optional field that would sometimes fail to follow a mismatch with a number.</li>
  <li>Added
      <tt><a href="manual.shtml#bowtie2-options-D">-D</a></tt>
	  option for controlling the maximum number of seed extensions that can fail in a row before we move on.  This option or something like it will eventually replace the argument to
      <tt><a href="manual.shtml#bowtie2-options-M">-M</a></tt>.</li>
  <li>Added
      <tt><a href="manual.shtml#bowtie2-options-R">-R</a></tt>
	  option to control maximum number of times re-seeding is attempted for a read with repetitive seeds.</li>
  <li>Changed default to
      <tt>--no-dovetail</tt>.  Specifying
	  <tt><a href="manual.shtml#bowtie2-options-dovetail">--dovetail</a></tt> turns it back on.</li>
  <li>Added second argument for
      <tt><a href="manual.shtml#bowtie2-options-mp">--mp</a></tt> option so that user can set maximum and minimum mismatch penalties at once.  Also tweaked the formula for calculating the quality-aware mismatch penalty.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Version 2.0.0-beta3 - November 1, 2011</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Accuracy improvements.</li>
  <li>Speed improvements in some situations.</li>
  <li>Fixed a handful of crashing bugs.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug whereby number of repetitively aligned reads could be misreported in the summary output.</li>
  <li>As always, thanks to everyone for their reports and feedback!  Please keep it coming.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Version 2.0.0-beta2 - October 16, 2011</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Added manual, both included in the download package and
     <a href="manual.shtml">on the website</a>.
     The website will always have the manual for the latest version.</li>
  <li>Added Linux 32-bit and 64-bit binary packages.  Mac OS X packages to come.
     Still working on a Windows package.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug that led to crashes when seed-alignment result memory was
     exhausted.</li>
  <li>Changed the
     <tt><a href="manual.shtml#bowtie2-options-end-to-end">--end-to-end</a></tt>
     mode
     <tt><a href="manual.shtml#bowtie2-options-score-min">--score-min</a></tt>
     default to be less permissive.
     The previous threshold seemed to be having an adverse effect on accuracy,
     though the fix implemented in this version comes at the expense of some
     sensitivity.</li>
  <li>Changed the
     <tt><a href="manual.shtml#bowtie2-options-end-to-end">--end-to-end</a></tt>
     mode
     <tt><a href="manual.shtml#bowtie2-options-M">-M</a></tt>
     default to be lower by 2 notches.  This
     offsets any adverse effect that the previous change would have had on
     speed, without a large adverse impact on accuracy.  As always, setting
     <tt><a href="manual.shtml#bowtie2-options-M">-M</a></tt>
     higher will yield still greater accuracy at the expense of speed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Version 2.0.0-beta1 - September 22, 2011</h2>
<ul>
  <li>First public release</li>
  <li>Caveats: as of now, the manual is incomplete, there's no tutorial, and no
      example genome or example reads.  All these will be fixed in upcoming
      releases.</li>
  <li>Only a source package is currently available.  Platform-specific binaries
      will be included in future releases.</li>
</ul>
