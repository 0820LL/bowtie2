Bowtie 2 TODO list:
- Soft/hard trimming taken into account when setting up paired-end problems?
- Represent overhanging alignments in SAM
- Mapping quality calculation?
- Some flags should only appear if they're relevant to mode (e.g. YP:i:)
- XS:i: can't default to 0 because it's ambiguous w/ aln of score 0
- Optional flags for printing original colorspace read/quals
- Optional flags AS:i:0, XS:i:0
- Bunch up sensitivity arguments into neat packages
- SAM flag indicating when and how reads are filtered out
- Include a test to show that --un/--max/--al work
- If alignment mode has no short circuiting, write alignments directly to
  output stream to save space and overhead

Performance ideas:
- Check whether a potential seed extend is redundant with a previous one
- Add resolved offsets to cache
- Add faster DP filter to run first
- Binary search to find reference records instead of linear scan
