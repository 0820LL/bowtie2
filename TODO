Bowtie 2 TODO list:
- Add SAM checks to simple_tests.pl
- Soft/hard trimming taken into account when setting up paired-end problems?
- Represent overhanging alignments in SAM
- Keep /0 and /1?
- Mapping quality calculation?
- Run random tests that include paired-end alignment
- Some flags should only appear if they're relevant to mode (e.g. YP:i:)
- XS:i: can't default to 0 because it's ambiguous w/ aln of score 0
- Optional flags for printing original colorspace read/quals

Performance ideas:
- Check whether a potential seed extend is redundant with a previous one
- Add resolved offsets to cache
- Add faster DP filter to run first
- Binary search to find reference records instead of linear scan
