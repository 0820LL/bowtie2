Bowtie 2 TODO list:
- Soft/hard trimming taken into account when setting up paired-end problems?
- Represent overhanging alignments in SAM
- Mapping quality calculation?
- Some flags should only appear if they're relevant to mode (e.g. YP:i:)
- XS:i: can't default to 0 because it's ambiguous w/ aln of score 0
- Optional flags for printing original colorspace read/quals
- Optional flags AS:i:0, XS:i:0
- Bunch up sensitivity arguments into neat packages
- SAM flag indicating when and how reads are filtered out
- Include a test to show that --un/--max/--al work
- If alignment mode has no short circuiting, write alignments directly to
  output stream to save space and overhead

Performance ideas:
- Check whether a potential seed extend is redundant with a previous one
  + Two general ways of doing this
    - By examining sequence
	- By examining offset (i.e. once a diagonal has been used for a seed, never use it again)
- Add resolved offsets to cache
- Add faster DP filter to run first
- Binary search to find reference records instead of linear scan
- Align seeds in random order and investigate each seed immediately after
  aligning it
- For local alignment, there's a number that equals the number of matches in a
  row that you have to have before it is possible for a valid alignment to pass
  through any cell involved.  We can at least partially make up for the lack of
  row skipping using this.
- If a seed is from the extreme end of the read, we don't have to add bands to
  the dyn prog extending in *both* directions, just the direction away from the
  end of the read.
